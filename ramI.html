            Random Access Memory (RAM) is a short-term storage memory.
            The operating system of computers or other devices uses RAM to temporarily store all programs and their
            execution processes.
            programs and their execution processes temporarily. RAM is loaded with all instructions that are executed by
            the central processing unit (CPU).
            The RAM contains all the instructions executed by the central processing unit (CPU) and other units of the
            computer, as well as the data manipulated by the various programs.

            In the event that the modules are missing or not detected, most motherboards emit a series of sounds
            indicating the absence of main memory. After this process, the memory
            BIOS can perform a basic test on the RAM memory indicating major RAM failures.
